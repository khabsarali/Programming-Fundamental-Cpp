# 🏢 Company Management System
### 🚀 First Semester Software Engineering Project

A fully functional, menu-driven **Company Management System** built using C++.  
This project demonstrates structured programming, authentication systems, financial calculations, and strong input validation techniques.

📖 About The Project

The Company Management System is a console-based application designed to manage core business operations including:

- Employee Management
- Project Management
- Expense Tracking
- Salary Management
- Financial Balance Calculation

The system includes secure login functionality for both Admin and Employees, along with complete validation to prevent runtime errors and invalid data entry.

This project was developed as part of my First Semester Software Engineering coursework to strengthen programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills.

✨ Key Highlights

✔ Secure Admin & Employee Login System  
✔ Complete Input Validation (Prevents System Crashes)  
✔ Salary & Payment Validation Logic  
✔ Project Assignment System  
✔ Expense Tracking  
✔ Financial Balance Calculation  
✔ Clean Modular Code Structure  
✔ Menu-Driven Interface  

🛡️ Validation & Error Handling

This project includes advanced validation mechanisms such as:

- Prevention of negative numeric inputs
- Protection against invalid (non-numeric) input
- Array overflow protection (MAX limit control)
- Salary received cannot exceed total salary
- Upfront payment cannot exceed project total cost
- Employee existence verification before project assignment
- Secure password-based employee authentication

These validations ensure system stability and user-friendly interaction.
